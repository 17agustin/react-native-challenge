# react-native-challenge

Hello! this a Carousel App made with react native

To Run the App you just need to:

- Clone the repo to your device
- Run <code>npm install</code> or <code>yarn install</code> to install the dependencies.
- then run the app with <code>npm start</code> or yarn <code>start</code>
- it  will open a new tab in your browser and give you an QR which you can scan with your phone.
- also in the browser you get the options to run the app in an android emulator or IOS simulator.

Hope you like it!
